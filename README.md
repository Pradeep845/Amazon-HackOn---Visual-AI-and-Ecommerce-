# Object Identification and Feature Extraction for Amazon Product Linking

## Overview

This repository contains code for identifying objects in a video using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. After identifying the objects, the code further analyzes each object to detect its color, size, and other relevant features. These details are then used to create a link to a corresponding product on Amazon.

## Features

- **Object Detection:** Utilizes the YOLO algorithm to identify various objects within video frames.
- **Feature Extraction:** Analyzes detected objects to determine characteristics such as color and size.
- **Amazon Product Linking:** Generates a link to a similar product on Amazon based on the extracted features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- YOLO model weights and configuration files
- Amazon Product Advertising API credentials

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-identification-amazon-link.git
   cd object-identification-amazon-link
